What a day. Long day at work, meaning, I was busy. I was closing the garage door and <!--more-->the tension spring snapped! I called around and got one guy that did not charge for free estimate. But once he arrived, the high pitch sale. OH MAN!!! Settled at $730.00 to replace two tension springs. Took about fifteen minutes. Not something I would attempt. I would rather pay the $730.00 than end up in the hospital or worse, in the morgue.  I can always make more money, but I cannot come back from the dead. üòÇ He said that the new springs "should" last ten years, if I open and close the three times a day. The life span will shorten with more usuage. I asked him if there are any garage openers that does not require a tension spring, he said no. I looked at my Mom's and her's doesn't have one. Probably why I never thought of something like that ever happening, as my Mom has owned her house over fifty years. So he was wrong!

Which reminds me to always check, even triple check when people provide me information. I would think he would know, since he is in the business. But sometimes the people that I think knows the most, knows the least. He did great work, this is coming from a person that knows nothing about garage door openers, except that clicking or pressing a button opens and closes them. But I do know he over charged me, but my time is far more important than to haggle over a few dollars, and having to get another person out to provide another estimate and go through the same. Just get over with and move on!

One thing I know, when things start to break, either earn more to be able to replace, or move. I think I will take the latter. üòÅ
