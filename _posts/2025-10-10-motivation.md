I do not know, but for some reason when the weekend is near I get really <!--more-->motivated! I believe because I do not have to follow my sleeping routine and can stay awake as long as my mind and body allows me. I have to push my motivation to be inspiration, as motivation dwindles and ultimately fades.

I had two mini Kitkats. ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜± After I ate the second one, I instantly regreted the sugar taste and rush. I am drinking lots of water. ðŸ˜‚

My day going well so far. I have knocked of my chapter read, my exercises, my pull up. I am going to study and carry that through the weekend!

Life is like a boulder being pushed up hill, should I stop, the boulder will only get heavier and eventually I will let go and the boulder will roll downhill. Should I keep pushing, one day, that boulder will reach the top and roll downhill on the otherside. I just need to keep pushing!

Keeping puching me! Tomorrow's me will thank you me.
