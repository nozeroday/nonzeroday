First Friday of October. There are twelve First Fridays in a given year. I have never really thought of this until I started to take my time seriouly. I was afraid in learning all this, creating a site and journaling my thoughts and experience, but now that I have started, I cannot stop. I believe I will be a better person because of this experinece... I have to go for a walk before the day gets late, kids and parents start to appear as they prepare for the day.  I will write more when I return... Something I will have to do, is schedule time when to do entries. Until I return...

My mind wandered while I walked, almost like a walking meditation, again just <strong>INCREDIBLE</strong>! Time to earn a living, good news: Today is <strong>FRIDAY</strong>, better news: <strong>I am employed</stong>. Until later...
