I started this site to keep track of my non-zero day, but I<!--more--> broke the streak of not have a non-zero day. I like the quote, "A chain is only as strong as the weakest link." I have found my weakest link. Now I can work on mending my chain.

Since I stopped my non-zero day, my weight also spiraled out of control. I am not 180 lbs. So today, I started walking. I walked three miles. I did twelve push-ups and twelve sit-ups. I will continue these three things until I do not think of doing them anymore. Once that occurs, I will add another.

Also, I have been using my Supernote Manta, and I am really liking the Manta, especially after I purchased a lamp for the Manta when I write. I did not see the feature to not have the light built in on the device itself, but now I do. I journal on my Manta every day and find new features as I used the Manta more. I will share a drawing tomorrow. 😁

End transmission...
