As much as I would not like to say, but nothing is truer than the saying, "Money is what makes the world <!--more-->go around". Without money, there is not much that I can do. I only get to live one life, and life is based on experiences. Without money, I can still have experiences, just not the ones that money can buy. An example, visiting countries, seeing concerts, etc... Life is short, even at life's longest, so quit horsing around and earn that money and go experience life!

End transmission...
