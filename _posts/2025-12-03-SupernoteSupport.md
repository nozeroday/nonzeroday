The Manta I purchased is basically useless. I do not want to put my notes on there, as the device is failing. I email Supernote Technical Support, and after one day I did not receive a reply. I called the Supernote Technical Support number <!--more--> and the result is the same.  Support appears to be coming from China, which is sixteen hours ahead of Seattle, Washington. Supernote Technical Support might also be real busy, but that is poor customer support experience. I have not experience this kind of support when buying, what I consider, an expensive device. I do not make $800 purchases at all. This is a large purchase for me. I am not a wealthy person. I thought I could use this device to journal and replace my pen and paper. I wanted to digitalize my journaling, so I can search and insert images to my journals and still maintain hand written journals. I currently print out my images and paste into my journals. Seems for a company selling expensive items, Supernote is a mom and pop shop. I have never experience this kind of support before. If I knew of this prior to the purchase, I probably would not have made the purchase. In the current state, I would not trust my journals on this device. Looking to have this device replaced or fixed, or even refunded.  I am upset that I purchased a lemon and was hoping that Supernote would make this right. But the delay in the Supernote Technical Support is unacceptable and making me emotionally involed, as frustration is starting to set in.
