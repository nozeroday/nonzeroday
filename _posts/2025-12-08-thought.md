As I sat watching the Los Angles Chargers play against the Philadelphia Eagles, a thought cross my mind, "If <!--more-->I did everything that I was to do, and did everything correctly, would I still end up where I am now?" 🤔 But how would I know if the path that I am on is the perfect or imperfect path? 🤔 Since there is no way for me to make that determination, I am therefore, more than likely, on the best path possible, as this is the path I am on.

End transmission...
