Sometimes I believe an item is determined by the monetary value that is given to the <!--more-->item. Not true. I discovered that sometimes I will pay more for cheap service and/or item. The value of the item does not change, the value of an item is determined by how much someone will pay for that item. If no one finds value in an item, then that item will eventually go to waste and disposed off. Just how life is.

I really need to start writing earlier. I still have lots in my head, but due to the time, I cannot continue. Always rushing!

End transmissionâ€¦
