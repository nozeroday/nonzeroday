I am so busy today, both with work and personal life. I was about to study, but thought to journal first, so I opened my Supernote Mantam, only to discover <!--more-->the Manta was not functioning. ARGH!!! Now I have to contact Supernote for warranty repair. GEEZ!!! I used three hours researching in getting the Manta working, but to no avail. I even factory reset the Manta, which started to work after the initial setup, but about ten minutes later, back to features not working. Oh well. I guess back to pen and paper until Supernote either fixes or replaces this one.

I really have to stick to my schedule, but one offs like this, what am I supposed to do? I am now three hours behind one what I was supposed to do, and the day is about to be refreshed in twenty-two minutes. Well, at least I got this in and me, I am proud what you were able to complete today as hacktic as the day was. Get a good nights rest and catch up tomorrow! I know tomorrow is not guaranteed, but the odds, I will be alive and can catch up and surpass what I have scheduled.

ARGH... I did another task and did not post! Now late by sixteen minutes. Well, at least I found out not too late. 😂

End of transmission...
