I started to meditate. I have been consistent with meditating fifteen minutes daily since the first of December. Since I have been meditating, I have been <!--more-->been feeling that I am starting to be more focused. Not a life altering kind of focus, but an increment, just a small enough difference in my thinking that I noticed there was a time today that I remained focused, even though distraction was trying to pull me away from my sense of thought. I know many people that do not meditate and are really focused on what they want to accomplish. I also have read of people that have dropped out of college and are financially successful. There are people that smoke and drink alcohol and live into their nineties, but these people are not the norm, they are the anomaly. I have to do what I find is right for me. Take the good and throw out the bad. Make small changes. So if ever I discover the change is a mistake, reverting to a previous state and reevaluating what went wrong and making the necessary change will not be as difficult.
