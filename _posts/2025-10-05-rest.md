I have been able to improve most of the things in my life with the <strong>Non-Zero Day</strong> mentality, except for one, <!--more-->sleep. I have been trying to go to sleep by 10:00 P.M., but have not been able to. I have been sleeping no earlier than 2:30 A.M. and waking up at 5:30 A.M. - 6:00 A.M. I will continue to challenge this sleeping habit. I want to really try the seven to eight hours of sleep per night and evaluate if sleeping more hours really does change me mentally and physically. I have to reevaluate what I am doing past 10:00 P.M. that is keeping me awake, and is my return on investment (ROI) worth more than if I was asleep. I will trying again tonight. I will start my routine of getting ready for sleep at 9:30 P.M., which means, I have approximately seven hours to complete everything that I need to complete for today from now.

Tossed and turned and just could not sleep. If once I do not succeed, try and try again. I will try again tomorrow, but for now, I will study JavaScript.
