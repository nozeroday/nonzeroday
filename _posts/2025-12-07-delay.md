Much of my life I have been putting things off, and because of doing so, my life has been <!--more-->put off as well. I am not as successful as I should be. Even this site, I have fallen to the prey of delay (resistance). No more. I dedicate myself to success. I will not say what I will do, as that removes my superpower to do. I will just say, I am committed to succeeding.
