How could have this had happen? I thought that I completed a post yestereday, yet, when I looked there<!--more--> was not post for yesterday, October 10, 2025.  I have missed a post! ARGH!!! How could this had happen? The only answer I could come out with, routine. My posts are not done at a specific time. I post when I get time when I am on my computer. Well, that will change. The thing about mistakes, I learn from them, and rarely do I make the same mistake twice. So I have come up with a schedule of when I will post. I will post at noon every day. This will be my routine. ARGH!!! Still so very upset, that my post streak has been broken. Lesson, schedule when I want to do something. I knew this. If I do not schedule something, then more than likely I will not do whatever I want to get done.

I was supposed to come up with an hourly schedule. ðŸ˜­

Come on me... I have to get a lot better than this. Don't let me down again me!

After saving this post, I noticed that this post was not showing up! I thought there was something working in how I was saving the posts, only to discover that I was saving the post in the wrong directory! I found yesterday's post in the same directory. WHEW!!! I thought I was going Looney Tunes!!!

I was going to add this image after I saved this post and discovered the post was missing...
