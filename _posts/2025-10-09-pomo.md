In my search to be a better me, I have found a tool called <!--more-->Pomodoro. Instead of me explaining the technique, I will let the this <a href="https://sketchplanations.com/the-pomodoro-technique" title="Pomodoro Technique" target="_blank">site</a> provide the explanation. I will start using this tool to start having more focus time. I, at times, wonder off into La La Land, and then find myself later regreting that I lost the time not being productive. I will do four promodoros per day to start. That is basically an hour of focued time.

Besides starting the pomodoro, I got a pull up bar. I cannot hoist myself up (yet). So for now, I am doing reverse pull up, until I can pull myself up. Huh... just like my life. ðŸ˜‚

One thing that I have a difficult time overcoming is procrastinating. I will have to start scheduling my life in to one hour increments, so I know what I should be doing every hour of the day and not get distracted.

AI Overview: The quote emphasizes challenging yourself to expand your vision and ambition beyond what feels comfortable or achievable. Hsieh taught that thinking big and thinking small require a similar amount of mental energy, so you might as well aim for something bigger.

Thank you me for finally getting me better!

End transmission...
