I have been thinking lately, and I do think a lot, not just in general, but specific thinks. I would look at something and <!--more-->images would come to my mind... I was looking at a picture on a wall, and I got an aha moment. If I do not put any effort in doing something to advance myself, then I will be stuck, not at a moment in life, but like a prisoner stuck in a six feet by eight feet room. Not doing anything that I am capable of doing, is the same as not having the ability to do that something. The only thing I have is the things that I can do. Which reminds me of...<br /><br />
<stong>Ecclesiastes 9:10</strong>: Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest.<br /><br />
How can I have a zero day if I can do?

End transmission...
