I received the Supernote Manta. I will write more tomorrow about the Supernote Manta. But today, I discoved something GREAT! I discovered <!--more--><a href="https://nextcloud.com/" title="Nextcloud" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a>!  I was doing an <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" title="Linux OS" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> install and saw an option to install <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" title="Nextcloud" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a>. I chose the option to install. I went through in creating my account and tried using the application. I have to say, WOW! What an app!!! I then discovered there is a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" title="Nextcloud" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a> app for Android and iOS. So I downloaded the app and gave a go. NOICE!!! I can upload the media from my phone to <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" title="Nextcloud" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a>. I can use <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" title="Nextcloud" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a> as a backup for my phone, and to be completely thorough, I can use a third party storage (offsite) with <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" title="Nextcloud" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a> as a complete backup solution.  I was just totally impressed by the Open source application. I will surely use this application more and get to know what else I can do with this application.

Supernote will be tomorrow. Just not what I expected, as far as presentation. I have not used the device. I have set aside, as I thought things out when I opened the box. Tomorrow...

End Transmission...
