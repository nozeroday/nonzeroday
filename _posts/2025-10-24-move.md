Time to reset. I have gone with too many days with Non-Zero Day. Why? I let work<!--more--> get in the way.  One thing I noticed, I am have been putting work ahead of my own self. Time to change that!  I am not living to work, I work to live. I must put myself first. I come first. Time to get back on the horse of Non-Zero Day. 

I forgive me of yesterday for missing what I realized today.  I have not studied, my diet is out of wack, and I never improved my sleeping. Time to change...

Me of tomorrow, remember this, be consistent in bettering me, and in anything I do, ask myself, "Is this something that I want to be doing every day?"

End transmission...
