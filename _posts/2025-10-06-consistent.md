I have been consistent on the things I have started since starting <strong>Non-Zero Day</strong>, and I have also manintain to be consistent on, <!--more-->not starting anything new. I have been consistent with my >= one mile walks, >= thirteen pushups and situps, but I have also been maintainig of not sleeping early and sleeping for at least six hours. I also started to study, but have not been able to maintain the hours I want to study.

Where did my time go today? Aside from work, I bought a Raspberry Pi 5B 16GB. I received all the parts that I wanted to do with this project. I used about four hours today installing, and configuring the Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) for the Pi. Then, I created a software RAID5, that came with a lot of research. I wanted to learn RAID% for redundancy. I am not doing a data center at my home, I just want to know how things work. I want to know what happens when a disk fails on a RAID5, how to change the drive and the rebuild process, etc... Well I have the RAID5 configured. I will use the Pi as a file server. I have not configured for SAMBA, another lesson for another day, maybe tomorrow. I am out of hours for today. ðŸ˜…

On another note, I started learning Kubernetes and Docker. This is my first step in learning to program, setting up my environment. Looking forward in learning a lot!!!

End transmission...
