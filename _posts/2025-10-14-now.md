Now! Do the things that I have to do now! I say now, but <!--more-->for some reason I delay to the last minute. Just like right now, I still have to meditate and waited the last minute to do my entry...

I am out of time.

Do better tomorrow, so I can put my thoughts down, instead of rushing! Common me of today... Do better!

End transmission...
