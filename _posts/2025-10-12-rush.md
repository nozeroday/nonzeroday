If I find myself rushing to finish something at the twelfth hour, that means that I have been <!--more-->procrastinating. I have not been doing what I was supposed to be doing. I have put in place of import something that is urgent. I learned this today. Here I am on the twelfth hour rushing to finish up little thing that are important and did a bunch of urgent things throughout the day.

Here are two matrix of the same about import and urgent to make clear for me.
