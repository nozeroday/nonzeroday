I have been strugling through life and really trying to find my way. I Googled, "How to remain consistent?" One of the results from my search lead me to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/" title="reddit post">reddit</a> post, <strong>The gospel of /u/ryans01. Helpful advice for anyone who wants to be more productive</strong>, and down the rabbit hole I went...

Google AI Overview:
A non-zero day is a day in which you complete at least one small action towards a personal goal or dream, even if it's just a tiny step. The core principle is to consistently create a chain of non-zero days, preventing days from becoming "zero days" where nothing at all is accomplished, to build momentum and achieve long-term goals. 
Key Concepts

## A "Zero Day": 

A day where you did absolutely nothing to move forward towards your goals or dreams. 
The "Non-Zero Day" Principle:
Vow to have no more zero days. Instead, commit to completing at least one small, meaningful task every single day. 

## Examples of Non-Zero Actions 

* Writing a single sentence or paragraph.
* Doing one push-up or one sit-up.
* Reading one page of a book.
* Typing the headline of a document, then saving it.
* Working out.
* Learning one new word. 

## Benefits of the Non-Zero Day Approach

* Builds Momentum: Consistent, small efforts prevent large gaps in progress and build momentum over time. 
* Fights Procrastination: It makes tasks seem less overwhelming and easier to start. 
* Encourages Consistency: It helps build a habit of daily action, reinforcing discipline. 
* Fosters Gratitude: The philosophy includes a rule to appreciate your past, present, and future selves. 
* Breaks Self-Sabotage: It helps break the cycle of feeling unproductive or self-loathing by focusing on even small wins
