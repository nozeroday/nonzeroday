Most of my life, I have been going in the wrong direction. I can tell, because numbers do not lie. I am overweight (at least forty-five pounds over), close to having zero in the bank (literally), borderline homeless (if I lose my job I have no alternative source of income), not as educated as I want to be. I pledge, that I will no longer have a <strong>Non-Zero Day</strong>! Moving forward I will improve in every aspect of my life (God, Family, Health and Education).

I here by <strong>PROMISE</strong> my future self, that I will hereby adhere to my words, that I will have a <strong>NON-ZERO DAY</strong> and will commit in doing and improving on each of the following daily:

* God:
    - Daily prayer
    - Daily gratitude
    
* Family:
    - Family time
    - <strong>Take more vacations!</strong> 

* Health:
     - Push-ups: No less than ten
     - Sit-up: No less than ten
     - Walk: No less than one mile

* Read: 
     - One Chapter of a book that inspires and/or changes my thinking

* Education:
     - Certification: At least one technical certification per month
     - One hour and/or more in the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Docker, AWS, Azure, Block chain, Solidity.
     
I will have a <strong>NON-ZERO DAY</strong>!
