Non-Zero Day
======================

A non-zero day is a day in which you complete at least one small action towards a personal goal or dream, even if it's just a tiny step. The core principle is to consistently create a chain of non-zero days, preventing days from becoming "zero days" where nothing at all is accomplished, to build momentum and achieve long-term goals.
